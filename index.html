                Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. You mean it controls your actions? Partially.
                But it also obeys your commands. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at
                your side, kid. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to
                the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one
                all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.
                It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your
                conscious self and act on instinct. With the blast shield down, I can't even see. How am I supposed to
                fight? Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.

                That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He tricked me into going this way, but he'll
                do no better. Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm saved! Over here! Help! Please, help! Artoo-Detoo!
                It's you! It's you!
              </p>

                Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid. Don't worry, he'll be all right. What
                happened? Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're still in one piece. Ben? Ben
                Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you! The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young
                Luke, what brings you out this far? Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for his former
                master...I've never seen such devotion in a droid before...there seems to be no stopping him. He claims
                to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about?

                Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty
                minutes. This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end
                of the Rebellion.

              <p>
                Run, Luke! Run!
